# Introduction
In a world increasingly driven by data, the ability to harness the power of data to solve complex problems and make informed decisions has become very important. This portfolio represents my journey through the fascinating realm of data science and machine learning. Through a series of carefully crafted projects, I aim to showcase not only my technical proficiency but also my passion for addressing real world challenges using data driven solutions.


# Background
The utility and significance of my portfolio come from its ability to demonstrate my expertise in data science and machine learning to future employers and collaborators. Data science has become the cornerstone of innovation across industries, from healthcare and finance to marketing and e-commerce. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has revolutionized predictive modeling, enabling accurate forecasting, pattern recognition, and automation.

## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis for California Housin

### Description:
In this project, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the California Housing dataset, aiming to gain insights into housing trends in various cities in California. The primary objective of this analysis is to provide valuable information to potential homebuyers, real estate professionals, and policymakers. By uncovering key patterns and trends in the data, this analysis can assist in making informed decisions regarding housing investments and urban planning.

### Data Sets: 
I used the ['California_Housing_Cities.csv'](https://github.com/DanielGiedraitis/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20for%20California%20Housin) dataset, which contains information on various features related to housing in California cities. The dataset consists of 20640 rows and 17 columns, including features like median house value, median income, population, and distance to important locations like the coast, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco.

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahsamman/california-housing-with-name-of-counties/data) and is relevant to the problem as it provides comprehensive information about housing in California cities.

### Data Processing Techniques:
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project. In this project, I performed several data processing tasks, including:
- Removal of the 'Id' column, which was irrelevant for the analysis.
- Handling of missing values by identifying and replacing empty strings with NaN values.
- Calculated new features to better understand the dataset.

### Code Samples:
  
### Tools and Technologies:
- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas for data handling
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Statsmodels for statistical analysis
- Plotly Express for interactive visualizations

### Techniques and Models:
In this project, I primarily focused on descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques. I used histograms, box plots, and QQ plots to understand the distribution and summary statistics of key features like median house value, median income, and median age. Scatter plots were used to explore relationships between median income and median house value in different cities.

### Visualizations:
I used various data visualizations to enhance our understanding of the California housing dataset. They provide a clear visual representation of the data distribution, relationships, and summary statistics. These visualizations include:
1. **Histograms:** Utilized to visualize the distribution of key variables, including Median House Value, Median Income, Median Age, Total Rooms, Total Bedrooms, Population, and Households. Histograms provide insights into the data's central tendencies and spread, allowing for a better understanding of the data's characteristics.
2. **Count Plot:** Used to display the distribution of the 'ocean_proximity' variable. This count plot helps to visualize the frequency of different categories within the variable, which helps to understand the makeup of the categorical data.
3. **Scatter Plot:** Created to illustrate the relationship between Median Income and Median House Value. Scatter plots reveal potential patterns or correlations between two continuous variables, helping identify trends in the data.
4. **Heatmap:** I used a heatmap to visualize missing data in the dataset. The heatmap provides a color-coded grid that helps us quickly identify areas with missing values. This is crucial for understanding the completeness of the dataset.
5. **Box Plots:** Used to visualize the distribution of Median House Value, Median Income, Median Age, Total Rooms, Total Bedrooms, Population, and Households. Box plots provide a summary of the data's central tendencies, spread, and the presence of outliers, facilitating comparisons across variables.
6. **QQ Plots:** I used QQ plots to check if the distributions of Median House Value and Median Income were close to a normal (bell-shaped) distribution. These plots helped us detect any deviations from the typical bell curve shape, which can be important for certain statistical analyses.

### Code Samples:

### Ethics and Regulations:
I have taken ethical considerations into account in this project. The dataset does not contain sensitive personal information, and I have not performed any advanced machine learning techniques that could potentially lead to bias or unfairness. I ensured the privacy of data by not disclosing any personally identifiable information.

Regarding regulations, I followed standard data handling practices and complied with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR.

### Opportunities and Challenges:
**Opportunities:**
- Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the factors influencing housing prices in California cities.
- The use of various data visualization techniques helped me communicate my findings effectively.

**Challenges:**
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, was necessary to ensure data quality.
- Selecting the most appropriate visualization techniques for each feature was a challenge but resulted in informative visualizations.
